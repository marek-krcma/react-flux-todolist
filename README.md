Application todolist is built on ReactJS framework and uses the Flux concept.
This application was created as a self-study project of ReactJS and Flux technologies.
Studying part was lead by this philosophy: Learn hard, code harder.

The application is divided into several parts based on Flux concept:
components - actions - dispatcher - store

The file naming corresponds Flux structure. ReactJS state is always lifting up to the closest
ancestor.

This application is not a rocket science project but it helped me a lot while 
I was studying ReactJS and Flux technologies. 

Application is built on webpack dev server. There is used objectassign package, 
css-loader and extract-text-webpack-plugin.

ToDo:
- extended list attributes
- modal window
- tagging functionality
- multiple states management
