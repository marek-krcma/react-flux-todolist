## Application motivation
This application was created as a self-study project of ReactJS and Flux technologies.
Application todolist is built on ReactJS framework and uses the Flux concept.
Studying part was lead by this philosophy: Learn hard, code harder.

This application is not a rocket science project but it helped me a lot while 
I was studying ReactJS and Flux technologies. 

## Hierarchy
The application is divided into several parts based on Flux concept:
components - actions - dispatcher - store

Store provides data model and data manipulation activities.

The file naming corresponds Flux structure. ReactJS state is always lifting up to the closest
ancestor.

css-loader and extract-text-webpack-plugin, ReactJS ecosystem.

## Functionalities which are under development
